About me
======

My name is Yuhao Jiang (蒋宇豪). I'm a postdoc researcher working with [Prof. Jamie Paik](https://people.epfl.ch/jamie.paik/?lang=en) at [Reconfigurable Robotics Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/rrl/), EPFL. My research interests lie in design, manufacture, modeling, optimization, and control of soft robotic systems.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Arizona State University in Aug. 2023 under the supervision of [Prof. Daniel Aukes](https://search.asu.edu/profile/2727366). I received my M.S. and B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering respectively from University of Florida and Donghua University.
