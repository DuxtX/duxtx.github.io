My name is Yuhao Jiang, I'm a PhD candidate major in Mechanical Engineering at [IDEALab](https://idealab.asu.edu/), Arizona State University, supervised by [Dr. Daniel Aukes](https://idealab.asu.edu/people/dan-aukes/). 

My research interests lie in design, manufacture, modeling, optimization, and control of soft robotic systems. More specifically, I study the curvature and shape change in soft surfaces and implementing these behaviors into novel soft robotic systems so that manufacture, actuation, and control difficulties in traditional soft robotic systems can be consolidated, this will extend the versatility of soft robotic systems in applications such as mobile robots, robotic manipulators, bio-inspired robots, and modular robotic systems.
